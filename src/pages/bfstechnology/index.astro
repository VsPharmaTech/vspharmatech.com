  title="Extrusion"
  heading="Parison Formation"
  description="Extrusion is the foundation of BFS technology, where pharmaceutical-grade plastic is melted and shaped into a hollow tube called a parison. Our precision-controlled extrusion system ensures uniform wall thickness, structural integrity, and sterility. The hot knife cutting system ensures clean separation, while multi-zone temperature control maintains optimal viscosity. A closed-loop monitoring system guarantees consistency, reducing contamination risks."

  title="Filling & De-Flashing"
  heading="Filling Zone & Parenteral Formation"
  description="Our BFS machines handle a variety of parenteral products, including Small Volume Parenterals (SVP) and Large Volume Parenterals (LVP), with customization options available. The Time-Pressure Dosing Mechanism guarantees precision, ensuring uniform liquid filling. Sterile air showers protect the filling zone, while the automatic de-flashing system removes excess plastic, delivering smooth, high-quality containers for pharmaceutical use."
